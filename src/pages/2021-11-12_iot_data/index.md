Capturing Value from the IoT
----------------------------

Digital Transformation drives an increasing integration between the physical and digital worlds---with IoT being a critical component not just in manufacturing, but smart cities, smart homes, smart cars, and much more. Realizing the business value of connecting all of these "things" enables creation of new revenue models, improves productivity, and generates new insights that drive operational efficiencies. IoT already connects billions of devices worldwide, and that number is growing daily. Many market observers predict that only by adopting IoT can organizations fully unlock the revenue opportunities promised by digital transformation. MongoDB, with its ability to efficiently handle and blend IoT and operational data in real-time, helps you to rapidly capture the most value from IoT.

WHAT YOU NEED FROM YOUR DATA PLATFORM

IoT Database Features with MongoDB

--------------------------------------

MongoDB---and its SaaS version, [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)---is the database of choice to help you meet your business needs with regard to IoT.

#### High-Speed Data Ingest and Real-Time Analytics

Each new generation of "thing" comes with new sensors, emitting unprecedented volumes of data and providing new insights into the business. Building and operating IoT applications requires a data platform capable of ingesting massive volumes of sensor and event data with concurrent support for real-time analysis to flag anomalies and critical events as they happen.

#### Event-Driven, Real-Time Architecture

An event-driven architecture creates a data pipeline where event producers---devices and gateways in your IoT network---generate a stream of events, and event consumers listen and react to those events in near real-time. Producers and consumers are all decoupled from each other, which removes dependencies between components, and the system can grow and shrink in response to demand.

#### Intelligent Edge

Today, the compute power of the cloud is moving to the edge. Instead of sending every bit of data from the sensor to the cloud, edge devices are becoming more intelligent, pre-aggregating data, performing analytics locally, and synchronizing data to the cloud. Not only does this reduce network traffic, it also allows for business insights to be made locally, increasing productivity.

### MongoDB Atlas

MongoDB Atlas is our on-demand, fully-managed, and global database-as-a-service (DBaaS) that runs on all leading cloud platforms so you can focus on apps, not ops.

A leader in the DBaaS space, Atlas radically simplifies development and operations, provides a persistence layer for event-driven architecture, and distributes data to consumers whenever and wherever needed.

Atlas lets you scale at the click of a button, in response to an API call, or fully automatically as loads grow, to keep up with the demands of your microservices---with no downtime, full security, and complete data protection.

Our newly available Time-Series Collections in MongoDB allow you to capture, process, and interact with Time-Series data with the same tools and simplicity as with other MongoDB data. New date operators and window functions give you insight in real-time to enable business applications that work in the now.

MongoDB Change Streams enables applications to stream real-time data changes in the database by leveraging MongoDB's underlying replication capabilities. Change Streams can notify your application of all writes to documents (including deletes) and provide access to all available information immediately as changes occur in the database.

Applications can consume change streams directly via a message queue, but MongoDB's Atlas Triggers provides a serverless way of consuming change stream events. MongoDB Change Streams drives Atlas Triggers to create responsive, event-driven pipelines.

Triggers can execute MongoDB Functions on predefined schedules or in real-time, responding to database changes or user authentication events.
