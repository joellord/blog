# Free Cloud Database
Fully supporting AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform, MongoDB Atlas is a fully managed cloud database that offers robust data management paired with the leading NoSQL database.

## Is MongoDB Free?

You can get started with a MongoDB developer sandbox in MongoDB Atlas [for free](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register) with basic configuration options. No credit cards are required to provision a cluster, and you can use it to explore and learn more about MongoDB Atlas, the database-as-a-service platform from MongoDB. 

A community edition of MongoDB, with a limited set of features, can also be [downloaded](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) from MongoDB’s download page. This local installation will require you to configure and manage your MongoDB instance on your infrastructure. This free-to-use version of MongoDB is available under the [server side public license (SSPL)](https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license/faq), which means you can use and modify the source code, but you can’t use the source code as a commercial SaaS offering. 

## How Much Does MongoDB Cost?

MongoDB has a flexible pricing structure. Starting with a [free tier](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register), MongoDB Atlas is the best way to learn and explore all the features the database-as-a-service platform has to offer. Once you are ready to go to production and require advanced features such as [sharding](https://www.mongodb.com/basics/sharding) or [backups](https://www.mongodb.com/basics/backup-and-restore), you can explore the option to [upgrade](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/scale-cluster/) to one of the paid tiers. Pricing [will vary](https://www.mongodb.com/pricing) depending on the size and resources required by your application. A [serverless offering](https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/launched-today-mongodb-5-0-serverless-atlas-evolution-application-data-platform) is also available for an even more flexible pricing option.

If you prefer to install, configure, and manage your instances of MongoDB, you can also [download](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) the community version. A commercial [Enterprise Advanced](https://www.mongodb.com/products/mongodb-enterprise-advanced) license is available for on-premise usage to benefit from all of the features MongoDB offers by contacting our [sales teams](https://www.mongodb.com/contact).

## Where Can I Download MongoDB?

If you want to try out MongoDB for free, the easiest way is to use [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register), the database-as-a-service platform by MongoDB. Yet, you sometimes might need to install a local version of the database. If you want to download MongoDB to run it on your infrastructure, you can find a community edition available for download on the MongoDB [download page](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community). 

## Is MongoDB Compass free?

MongoDB [Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass), the graphical user interface (GUI) for querying, analyzing, and managing your data on MongoDB clusters, is [free to use](https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/compass-now-free-for-all). It is available for download on macOS, Windows, and Linux on the MongoDB [download page](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass). 

## Is MongoDB Ops Manager free?

MongoDB [Ops Manager](https://www.mongodb.com/products/ops-manager) is a tool to help your operation team manage your MongoDB instances. Ops Manager is available as part of the MongoDB Enterprise Advanced subscription. It can be found on the MongoDB [download page](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/ops-manager).
