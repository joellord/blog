#### Sharing

Easily share your MongoDB Charts dashboards with any user in your organization. You can also create public links to publish your dashboard publicly to any visitor.

Data is automatically synced with your [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) instance.

#### Importing/Exporting

You can reuse MongoDB Charts dashboards across projects with the [import and export](https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/import-export-your-charts-dashboards) feature.

Export an entire dashboard with a single click, and import this JSON file into any other project to recreate the same visualization on another data source.

#### Filtering

Add powerful [filtering](https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/filter-your-dashboards-with-mongodb-charts) options to your dashboards so your users can customize the dashboard to their specific needs.

Filtering is applied on the current user view only and will not affect the dashboard for other viewers, making it easy to work as a team.

Dashboards with Charts to support every data type
-------------------------------------------------

MongoDB Charts offers chart types for just about any kind of data. The flexibility of chart types helps you create public or private dashboards that convey the information demanded by your data and business.

-   Bar Chart: [Bar charts](https://docs.mongodb.com/charts/saas/chart-type-reference/column-bar-chart/#std-label-column-bar-chart-ref) are used to visualize values in different categories or groups.
-   Column Chart: [Column charts](https://docs.mongodb.com/charts/saas/chart-type-reference/column-bar-chart/#std-label-column-bar-chart-ref) can be used to illustrate comparisons across different categories.
-   Combo Chart: [Combo charts](https://docs.mongodb.com/charts/saas/chart-type-reference/combo-charts/#std-label-combo-chart-ref) are a mix of column and line charts. They are helpful in comparing two related data sets.
-   Line Chart: [Line charts](https://docs.mongodb.com/charts/saas/chart-type-reference/line-area-chart/#std-label-line-area-chart-ref) are ideal for displaying data trends over time.
-   Area Chart: [Area charts](https://docs.mongodb.com/charts/saas/chart-type-reference/line-area-chart/#std-label-line-area-chart-ref) combine bar charts and line charts to display how a value is trending compared to another one.
-   Grids: Grids can be used to display values in function of two distinct variables as a [heatmap](https://docs.mongodb.com/charts/saas/chart-type-reference/heatmap/#std-label-heatmap-chart-ref) or a [scatter chart](https://docs.mongodb.com/charts/saas/chart-type-reference/scatter-chart/#std-label-scatter-chart-ref).
-   Circular Chart: Circular charts are used to display the percentage value of each sub-item as part of a whole. They come in two flavours, [donut charts](https://docs.mongodb.com/charts/saas/chart-type-reference/donut-chart/#std-label-donut-chart-ref) or [gauge charts](https://docs.mongodb.com/charts/saas/chart-type-reference/gauge-chart/#std-label-gauge-chart-ref).
-   Text: Text charts can be used to show a [single specific metric](https://docs.mongodb.com/charts/saas/chart-type-reference/number-chart/#std-label-number-chart-ref), a [table of data](https://docs.mongodb.com/charts/saas/chart-type-reference/data-table/#std-label-data-table-ref), or even a [word cloud](https://docs.mongodb.com/charts/saas/chart-type-reference/word-cloud/#std-label-word-cloud-ref).
-   Geospatial: [Geospatial](https://docs.mongodb.com/charts/saas/chart-type-reference/geo-spatial/#std-label-geo-spatial) data can be plotted automatically on a map to display heat maps or scatter plots.

### Easily Visualize Your Data

MongoDB Charts lets you create a collection of charts grouped in a dashboard by connecting directly to your [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) data with no extra setup. No need to duplicate or transform your data; you can use data in JSON format directly. If your data is stored elsewhere or even in a CSV format, MongoDB has got you covered. Using a [Data Lake](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/data-lake), you can connect data from AWS S3 into a MongoDB Chart.

### Quickly Share Your Dashboards

MongoDB Charts makes it easy for teams to collaborate on single dashboards. You can fine-tune permissions for users to allow editing or viewing rights only. The dashboards also have advanced filtering options to let viewers select data that is specific to their needs.

### Create Powerful, Actionable Insights

Using dashboards in MongoDB Charts, you can create an engaging user experience for all users, whether internal or external. Integrated directly into Atlas and always up to date, dashboards in MongoDB Charts make it easy for your users to make data-driven decisions.
