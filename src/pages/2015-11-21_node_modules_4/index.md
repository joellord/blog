Ok, so you've [created your own
module](/blog/post/2015-11-18_node_modules_1), you've [prepared your
package file](/blog/post/2015-11-20_node_modules_2) and you ensure that
your package is [thoroughly
tested](/blog/post/2015-11-21_node_modules_3). Let's publish it \!

## Ready for fame?

Are you finally ready to publish your node module? Are you ready for
fame? Here is the last and final step to publish your module.

## Check if it already exits

I guess I should've mentioned this in [part
1](/blog/post/2015-11-18_node_modules_1) but before you try to create a
new module, make sure that there isn't one that exists already with the
same name. Also check for similar functionalities. Is it worth it to
take the time to publish it if there is already one similar module? Does
your module accomplish something different from the others out there? If
you are sure that your baby is unique and worth shring, go ahead and
publish\!

## Publish it

If you've followed all the steps for far, publishing your module should
be a simple matter of entering this command.

    npm publish

Now go to [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com) and check for your module.
It should now be there and available for the whole world to npm install
\!

## Summary

That's all folks \! You now have your npm module published. If you have
any questions or comments, feel free to drop me a DM on Twitter or an
email. You will find the links at the bottom of this page.
