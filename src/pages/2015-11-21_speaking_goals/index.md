I've just decided that this blog would not only be about technical
stuff. I will add some bits about me from time to time. Here is one
little blog piece about myself. In order for me to progress as a public
speaker, I feel that I need to set myself some speaking goals. Here they
are.

## Local goals

For the next year, I would like to talk in at least 2 local conferences.
Local is a bit of a strech. The number of Javascript conferences is
limited in the Ottawa region so I will include Montreal and Toronto to
the list of locals.

## Meetups

There is a local meetup that has a great community around it. If you
have never heard of Ottawa Javascript, [look them
up](http://ottawajs.org). I will try to have at least 2 talks there (or
in another meetup/user group) this year.

## International

Finally, I'd really want to give a talk in another country. This would
have to be in a city that I have never visited.
